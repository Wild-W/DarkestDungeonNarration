# DarkestDungeonNarration

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2919359579

This mod adds the ancestor narrator from Darkest Dungeons to Terraria.

Basically, whenever a boss fight is active: key actions (such as dying, a teammate respawning, healing, defeating the boss) will have random narrations added to them.

You can disable any of the narrations and adjust the volume in the Mod Config.
